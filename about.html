<h1>A Little About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alex Malone</p>
<p>I am 18</p>
<p>I enjoy reading, writing, and playing the occasional video game</p>
<p>I have been active in the Drama Club for the past three years, and hope to do so again this year</p>
<p>I am taking four AP classes this year, and I hope to score good grades in all of them in hopes of raising my GPA to get into a good college</p>
<p>I enjoy a lot of different types of music, but I mostly listen to Lofi</p>
